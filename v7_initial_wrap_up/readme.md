# Generating simple waveforms using a raspberry pico and micropython 

(directory location is: v7_initial_wrap_up)

This directory should be used to try to finalize the squarewave project. I.e. more focus on documentation and clean code.

## requirements

The waveform we want to generate can be thought of beeing generated by three rotation gears. This might help to memorize the signals we want to generate. The circuit will be used to simulate signals used in the control electronics of a car. The examples given here are generic and can be used to generate arbitrary cyclic signals.

The focus of this write down should be to present how easy it is to generate this signals using a raspbery pico and micropython interaction.

*insert svg here,  IGF, CS, CRKS - camshaft, crankshaft, ignition confirmation signal, Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP), Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP) todo*

Above in the picture you can see three gears. The first gear with a lot of gear tooths can be thought of to generate the CKP signal (crankshaft position sensor), the second gear with three gear tooths generates the CMP signal (camshaft position sensor) and the third gear with four gear tooths generates the IGF signal (ignition confirmation signal). The second and third wheel rotate twice as fast as the first wheel.

You do not have to bother about the abbreviations of the signals - you could also denote the wheels and respective signals A, B, C. Sticking to the abbriviations (todo rechtschreibung) CKP, CMP and IGF just help me to document my project.

Suppose you put a light sensor at a fixed position that could measure the gear tooths of the rotation wheel passing by. Furher on suppose each tooth passing by generates a high signal for 25% percent and a low signal for 75% of the time. So having 34 tooths and 2 gaps in one rotation we can divide the signal corresponding to one rotation into 144 instances in time, e.g. (34+2)\*4. The multiplier corresponds to the 3/4 ratio of the signal.
